Only one spirit may ride the voodooist at a time, though the caster may drop the spell at any time and start another if she chooses. \n\n<em>Aspect of the rada loa</em> invites the spirit into her body, giving her some of its personality (noted in each power). That loa remains for the entire Duration, and no other loa may be invited in until the previous spirit leaves. \n\n<strong>Range:</strong> The voodooist can only cast this spell on herself, though the Range to any target is the caster’s Spirit. This can’t be increased with the Range Power Modifier since it’s not the Range of the power itself. \n\n- <strong>AGWÉ:</strong> This loa rules over the great waters and all that dwells within them. He is most often depicted as a tall, handsome man with deep green eyes wearing formal clothes, crying salt tears for the slaves transported across the ocean during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Those ridden by Agwé are morose and easily brought to tears. \n\nThe spell allows the voodooist mastery of the water for the Duration of the power. She may walk upon it, breathe beneath its surface, and swim at her full Pace (plus running die if desired). With a raise, she adds +2 to her total Pace each round.\n\n- <strong>BARON SAMEDI:</strong> Samedi appears as a tall man in black hat, dark glasses, formal coat with tails, cotton plugs in his nose, and painted skull face. He is a dirty-minded and foul-mouthed loa who relishes human vices. Samedi is the loa of the dead and gatekeeper to the Hunting Grounds. Anyone possessed by the Baron becomes bawdy and salacious. \n\nSamedi temporarily severs an undead creature’s link to the Hunting Grounds. If a creature with the undead Special Ability moves adjacent to the voodooist, it must make a Vigor roll (at –2 if cast with a raise) or be Stunned.\n\n- <strong>DAMBALLA:</strong> The ancient creator of the world once lay beneath the earth in serpent form. It was he who created the mountains and the skies and the seas and all that humanity beholds. He’s a powerful, pristine loa who communicates messages of wealth, prosperity, and health through dreams. Casters who invite Damballa into their body become more patient and kind, with a long view to the cosmos and all who dwell in it. \n\nYou can reroll any Vigor roll for the Duration of the spell. If using the Wealth rules from <em>SWADE</em>, you can also reroll any Wealth roll for the Duration of the spell. If not, reroll any Persuasion rolls to haggle or otherwise negotiate prices to get a better deal (a discount the GM feels is appropriate for the particular situation). All rolls are made at +1 if the spell is cast with a raise.\n\n- <strong>ERZULIE FRÉDA:</strong> Erzulie appears as a “black Madonna,” a loa of love and femininity. While beautiful and kind, she’s also quick-tempered. When ridden by Erzulie, the voodooist also adopts these traits. \n\nThe power grants the hero favor with a single individual who is romantically inclined toward his or her gender and starts with a Neutral or better Reaction (see the Reaction Table in <em>SWADE</em>). This isn’t the <em>puppet</em> power— the individual isn’t a mind-controlled slave—he or she is just eager to please the houngan or mambo. A raise means the target is even more eager to aid the voodooist. \n\nOnce the power expires, the target may rethink his or her commitment depending on the situation. Of course the voodooist can always channel Erzulie Fréda and rekindle the relationship anew.\n\n- <strong>PAPA LEGBA:</strong> Legba is the great communicator. He is depicted as an old man with a cane, wearing a broad rimmed straw hat and smoking a pipe, and is often accompanied by a loyal dog. When he rides an individual, she becomes more patient, wise, and sympathetic. \n\nThe houngan or mambo gets a free reroll on any Persuasion, Intimidation, or Taunt Tests for the Duration of the possession (at +1 if cast with a raise).",

She races toward them, screeching with the stump of her severed tongue, eyes black as night and blood-stained hands reaching out for vengeance. She passes through their form and chills them to the very marrow…then disappears.\n\n- <strong>MARINETTE BWA CHECH (“Marinette of the Dry Arms”)</strong>: This terrifying petro loa is a tall, almost skeletal figure with wild hair, mad eyes, and parched skin wearing ragged, blood-stained clothes. Those ridden by Marinette gain the Mean Hindrance. \n\nMarinette extends her host’s Fighting attacks to Reach 2, and Str+d6, AP 2 if unarmed. The damage is increased to Str+d8 if cast with a raise. \n\nAnyone struck by the voodooist sees a ghostly image of the horrific Marinette transposed over the attacker, screaming obscenities in her mad fury as she reaches out with her horrific dry arms and long, jagged claws.\n\n- <strong>MET KALFU:</strong> Kalfu is the dark side of Papa Legba. He appears as a suave man in a top hat with a forked tongue. He is another loa of the crossroads between worlds, with influence over dark spirits and emotions. Those who invoke Kalfu gain the Ruthless (Minor) Hindrance. Voodooists who already have the Hindrance do not suffer the −2 to the Spirit roll below.\n\nAs master of strange, spiritual energies, Kalfu can sever a target’s ties with Fate itself. Any time a foe spends a Benny and the voodooist wants to counter it, he may make a Spirit roll at –2 (or no penalty if cast with a raise). If successful, no Benny can be spent on that roll. With a raise, the Benny is lost as well! \n\nWhen an opponent’s luck is countered, he sees a ghostly image of Kalfu greedily drawing the energy into his mouth and devouring it with glee. ",
