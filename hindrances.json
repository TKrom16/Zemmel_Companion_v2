Your cowpoke suffers from a chronic and at least so far incurable disease of some sort. \n\nThe Minor version of the Hindrance means you subtract 1 from any roll made to resist Fatigue from any source. Subtract 2 if it’s a Major Hindrance. \n\nA Critical Failure on such a roll means things are getting worse. If your pistolero has the Minor version, she gets worse and her Hindrance becomes Major. If she already has the Major version, the Reaper comes calling. The good news is you gain an immediate point of Conviction. The bad news is you choose when and how your hero dies during that session. She might go out in a blaze of glory or surrounded by friends on a peaceful mountaintop. \n\nWhen your character finally passes, the other player characters gain a point of Conviction, drawing strength from the brave death of their stalwart companion. \n\nYou can also buy off your Hindrance by spending an Advance (two for the Major version of the Hindrance). You should work with the Marshal to figure out a narrative reason for the improvement—treatment at a sanatorium, a miracle cure, a transfusion from a unique donor, or some other story based explanation for the character’s miraculous improvement.",
